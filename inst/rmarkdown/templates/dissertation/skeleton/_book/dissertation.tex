% 2) Make sure that you have the LATEST version of the AUTHESIS class files
%    before you hand in the final version of your thesis or dissertation.
% 3) SPA students can uncomment the next two lines:
%\renewcommand{\schoolorcollege}{School of Public Affairs}

% To use longtable, add the following code to your preamble.
% Long table captions are single-spaced, but AU requires a

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}

Every dissertation should have an introduction. The introduction should
introduce the concepts, background, and goals of the dissertation.

\section{\texorpdfstring{My First Section Title \newline With 48 or
Fewer Characters Per
Line}{My First Section Title With 48 or Fewer Characters Per Line}}\label{my-first-section-title-with-48-or-fewer-characters-per-line}

This is the first sentence of the first paragraph of the first section.
Cool, eh? This paragraph includes inline higher mathematics: \(y=f(x)\).
This paragraph also includes a display equation:
\begin{equation}
h = f \circ g
\end{equation}
Furthermore, this section includes a floating table.

Another paragraph. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence.
Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence.

Here is a footnote.}
\begin{table}[ht]\centering
\caption{A normalsize table.
Captions for tables must go above the table.
Table captions must be single-spaced,
and the code indicates that they should be formatted as such.}
\begin{tabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline
TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\small Use ctable or booktab for better looking tables.}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsection{Long Tables}\label{long-tables}

If possible, break long tables into pieces. If you must, you can use the
\texttt{longtable} package. Get the supporting code from the preamble of
autest.tex. However, be aware that the \texttt{longtable} environment
can create problems. In particular, a \texttt{longtable} does not float,
so table numbering may end up out of order.

\subsection{Long Section Names: First subsection of first section of
introduction which is intentionally long to see what happens if it needs
to break a
line}\label{long-section-names-first-subsection-of-first-section-of-introduction-which-is-intentionally-long-to-see-what-happens-if-it-needs-to-break-a-line}

Another approach to fitting large tables is to shrink the fontsize. We
provide the \texttt{scriptsizetabluar} environment to help you with
this. Note that you can have a different caption in your List of Tables
than in the text, if you wish.
\begin{table}\centering
\caption[Alternative caption for List of Tables]{A table using scriptsizetabluar.}
\begin{scriptsizetabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline
TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\end{scriptsizetabular}

\chapter{PREVIOUS WORK}\label{previous-work}

Some other research was once performed.

Some was good and some was bad.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}\label{subsubsection}

Surely mine will be better. Here is a bulleted list of reasons why.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reason 1.
Some people hate the way test wraps in our bulleted lists,
but that is what the Guide says we have to do---apparently based on Turabian.
You can argue with CAS if you wish \dots

\item Reason 3.
\item Reason 4.
