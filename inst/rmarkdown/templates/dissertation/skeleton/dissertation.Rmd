  This is an abstractn.  It has a page number. (AU no longer wants you to provide an unnumbered abstract page.) The Guide says an abstract should not exceed 350 words. (If you do exceed this, then under the CAS option, the first page is numbered bottom center, and the rest are numbered top right.) This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn.

# INTRODUCTION

Every dissertation should have an introduction.
The introduction should introduce the concepts, background, and goals of the dissertation.

## My First Section Title \newline With 48 or Fewer Characters Per Line

This is the first sentence of the first paragraph of the first section. Cool, eh?
This paragraph includes inline higher mathematics: $y=f(x)$.
This paragraph also includes a display equation:
\begin{equation}
h = f \circ g
\end{equation}
Furthermore, this section includes a floating table.

Another paragraph.
Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence. Another sentence.
\footnote{
Here is a footnote.}


\begin{table}[ht]\centering
\caption{A normalsize table.
Captions for tables must go above the table.
Table captions must be single-spaced,
and the code indicates that they should be formatted as such.}
\begin{tabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline
TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\small Use ctable or booktab for better looking tables.}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


### Long Tables

If possible, break long tables into pieces.
If you must, you can use the \texttt{longtable} package.
Get the supporting code from the preamble of autest.tex.
However, be aware that the \texttt{longtable} environment
can create problems.
In particular, a \texttt{longtable} does not float,
so table numbering may end up out of order.



### Long Section Names: First subsection of first section of introduction which is intentionally long to see what happens if it needs to break a line


Another approach to fitting large tables is to shrink the fontsize.
We provide the \texttt{scriptsizetabluar} environment to help you with this.
Note that you can have a different caption in your List of Tables than
in the text, if you wish.

\begin{table}\centering
\caption[Alternative caption for List of Tables]{A table using scriptsizetabluar.}
\begin{scriptsizetabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline
TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\end{scriptsizetabular}
\end{table}

# PREVIOUS WORK

Some other research was once performed.

## Section

Some was good and some was bad.

### Subsection

Some was neither good or bad.

#### Subsubsection

Surely mine will be better.
Here is a bulleted list of reasons why.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reason 1.
Some people hate the way test wraps in our bulleted lists,
but that is what the Guide says we have to do---apparently based on Turabian.
You can argue with CAS if you wish \dots
\item Reason 2.
\item Reason 3.
\item Reason 4.
