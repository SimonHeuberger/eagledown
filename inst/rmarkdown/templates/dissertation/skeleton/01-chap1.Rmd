# INTRODUCTION

Every dissertation should have an introduction.
The introduction should introduce the concepts, background, and goals of the dissertation.

## My First Section Title \newline With 48 or Fewer Characters Per Line {#introduction-first-section}

This is the first sentence of the first paragraph of the first section. Cool, eh?
This paragraph includes inline higher mathematics: $y=f(x)$.
This paragraph also includes a display equation:
\begin{equation}
h = f \circ g
\end{equation}
Furthermore, this section includes a floating table.

\begin{table}[h]\centering
\caption{A normalsize table.
Captions for tables must go above the table.
Table captions must be single-spaced,
and the code indicates that they should be formatted as such.}
\begin{tabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline
TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\small Use ctable or booktab for better looking tables.}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


### Long Tables

If possible, break long tables into pieces.
If you must, you can use the \texttt{longtable} package.
Get the supporting code from the preamble of autest.tex.
However, be aware that the \texttt{longtable} environment
can create problems.
In particular, a \texttt{longtable} does not float,
so table numbering may end up out of order.

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{ll}\hline\hline
\caption{Note that you must also place captions for longtables above your table.
This is not handled for you by \LaTeX.}

### Long Section Names: First subsection of first section of introduction which is intentionally long to see what happens if it needs to break a line


Another approach to fitting large tables is to shrink the fontsize.
We provide the \texttt{scriptsizetabluar} environment to help you with this.
Note that you can have a different caption in your List of Tables than
in the text, if you wish.

\begin{table}\centering
\caption[Alternative caption for List of Tables]{A table using scriptsizetabluar.}
\begin{scriptsizetabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline
TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\end{scriptsizetabular}
\end{table}
