# PREVIOUS WORK {#previous-work}

Some other research was once performed.

Here is the first equation:
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

Here is a second equation:
\begin{equation}
y = X\beta + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Here is a third equation with bold and stuff for matrix representation:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta} + \mathbf{\epsilon} (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

This is how you refer back to an equation, e.g. equation \@ref(eq:binom).
It is not possible to use Markdown math ($) commands to show equations for this template, as Markdown currently neither shows the equation number nor provides the ability to link to the equation.


## Section {#previous-work-first-section}

Some was good and some was bad.



### Subsection {#previous-work-first-section-first-subsection}

Some was neither good or bad.


#### Subsubsection {#previous-work-first-section-first-subsection-first-subsubsection}

Surely mine will be better.
Here is a bulleted list.
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 1.
One of many items.
\item Item 2.
\item Item 3.
\item Item 4.
\end{itemize}

The AU template heavily modifies the `itemize` environment, so it is better to use it instead of Markdown-generated lists.
